An Online Bookstore Management project made using Spring Boot.
The Online Book Store Management System is a robust application developed using a range of technologies, focusing on creating a seamless and efficient platform for managing books and customer interactions. The project employs HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end, with Spring Boot as the middleware. For database connectivity, it uses Spring Data JPA, while MySQL/PostgreSQL is utilized for storing details. The system's architecture is based on microservices, and it leverages RESTful Web Services [REST API] to handle communication between services.

As the team lead, I was responsible for overseeing the project and specifically handled the development of the admin module and the add-to-cart module within the user/customer's module. I managed both the backend and the UI for these modules, ensuring they were both functional and user-friendly.

This project provided me with hands-on experience in enterprise-level application development, sharpening my skills in both backend and front-end technologies and preparing me to excel in complex, dynamic environments.
